Initial release of Milople Magento 2 Coding Standards. This package includes the following checks for code consistency across all Magento 2 extensions:

- **Class Name Prefix**: Ensures class names are prefixed with `Mi`, following the Milople naming convention.
- **Constant Name Prefix**: Verifies that all constant names are prefixed with `MI`, ensuring consistency across extension constants.
- **Function Name Prefix**: Checks if function names begin with `mi`, aligning function names with Milople's standard.
- **Interface Name Prefix**: Validates that interface names are prefixed by `Mi`, differentiating them clearly from other entities.
- **Trait Name Prefix**: Ensures trait names follow the convention and are prefixed with `Mi` to maintain readability and consistency.
- **Variable Name Prefix**: Ensures all variable names start with `mi`, enforcing a consistent naming convention throughout the codebase.
